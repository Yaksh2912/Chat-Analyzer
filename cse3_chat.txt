[04/03/24, 1:07:57 PM] Amartya Kumar: My final statement to this issue - 
I'm deeply disappointed by your actions and the way you've chosen to betray the trust of our class. We've worked hard to build a supportive and respectful community, and your betrayal has shaken that foundation. Your actions have not only affected me personally but have also had a negative impact on everyone here. It's disheartening to see someone we considered a friend act in such a manner. Moving forward, I hope we can address this issue and work towards rebuilding the trust and unity that once defined our class.
[04/03/24, 1:10:24 PM] aman Bmu: Poll mai bhi (no) per kisi ne click nahi kiya per phir bhi class gaya . Never ever trust these type of people aur kya baaki 57 loog pagal tha jinhone class attend nehi ki . Aur gaya ho to Kam se kam jooth to mast bolo. Haad kar di .

[25/04/24, 10:47:03 AM] Yuvraj Arora Bmu: Dear Students,

We are excited to invite you to the “Reuseable Indoor Hot Air Ballon Workshop cum competition” on April 29-30, 2024. This workshop is organized by School of Engineering and Technology at BML Munjal University. It will cover various topics related to Reuseable Indoor Hot Air Ballon includes design, built and fly. The training session will be taken by an eminent speaker in the field of sustainable aviation, Dr. Rajkumar S. Pant who is a Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, with a focus on the design and development of Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) systems. He has been an active member and pioneer in the Design and Engineering of Lighter-than-Air Systems. Prof. Pant also specializes in consultancy in areas of aircraft design, modelling, and simulation. This workshop is open for batches 2023, 2022, and 2021 of SoET.

The aim of this workshop is to train students on how to design and fabricate an indoor hot air balloon which can achieve an altitude of around 50 ft from the floor, while carrying some payload. The students are allowed to use their creativity in deciding the shape and material of the balloon, and the mechanism to generate hot air. The workshop will showcase the procedure for sizing and design of a hot air balloon of one sample shape. Various options for materials for creating the balloon, and schemes to generate hot air will be discussed. The workshop then moves on to the design process, explaining in detail the calculations involved in sizing the indoor hot air balloon and, the criteria for selecting the size and shape of the balloon. The participants will be divided into teams to fabricate their own indoor hot air balloons overnight and the finally the workshop will conclude by accessing the design and performance of the indoor hot air balloons made by the students in the form of a competition to be held in MPH. The key aim of the workshop is to give the participants a flavour of conceiving, developing, and testing of a simple buoyancy-based system to meet certain requirements within operational constraints. The competitive element is introduced to create some fun and excitement in the activity. The material cost for the balloons will be borne by the university. There is no registration fee for the event, however, you will have to register your names at the registration desk on the day of the event or online. Happy to inform that, winning teams (1st, 2nd, 3rd) will be rewarded with a cash prize. Please refer to the attached document for more information.

We look forward to your participation in this exciting workshop. 
Meet amit sir, Tirath sir for participation  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDX8ZAbBqt4owIAWeO4xK975akkUpoZqAeFeA8bEBBz3pn2A/viewform?usp=sf_link

Manish was an integral part of our community, known for his kindness, unscathed determination and his leadership. His untimely departure has left a void in our hearts and our campus that will not easily be filled.

Let's all come together in the memory of Manish Kumar and pay our final respects to him.

Best regards
M. Mahaansh Reddy
President, Student Council

[06/08/24, 1:08:06 PM] Yash Upadhyay: you are right at your place but you know everyone's WhatsApp is flooded with election promotion messages and it sometimes gets annoying for us to navigate our way to useful messages in the cluttered chat box. Those who are interested to vote have already decided whom to vote for and joined the relevant WhatsApp groups for votings and those who aren't interested will not even cast their vote, so I think it is pointless and would really appreciate if no one in this group promotes elections.

[06/03/25, 5:31:35 PM] Aarav: Greetings everyone, 
Owing to the festivities most of the students are leaving due to which we have tried our level best to reschedule or cancel the classes. As of now, there is no issue in leaving the classes of MAD, SE, COA and DT. 
Our faculties have clearly specified if even 1 student goes everyone else will be marked as absent. 

We request to leave the classes for next week. 


ML classes have not been cancelled or rescheduled. But all of us have collectively decided to not attend these classes.

[10/03/25, 3:12:52 PM] aman Bmu: I think daksh has a valid point if the major portion of the class is not able to attend the class due to some valid reason or circumstances then there should be  unity in the class and all of us should support each other in every situation as much as possible and if there is any valid reason because of which an individual is attending the class then he should said his her reason in the group but this kind of behaviour shows that people 
are having concern with themselves only . We are in college not in school.
